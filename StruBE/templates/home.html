<h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>Prof. Arold's research is dedicated to elucidating the molecular
    basis of the function and (de)regulation of proteins central to cellular
    key signaling networks in plants, and animals. Investigations are based on
    an integrated structural biology approach that combines functional and
    structural data from multiple sources (small angle x-ray scattering, X-ray
    crystallography, NMR, cryo-EM, computational methods, biochemistry, ligand
    binding assays and functional analyses). Results are translated to engineer
    molecules with desired properties (e.g. reporters or inhibitors).
    Structural biology approaches are also used to enhance computational
    methods for functional annotation of genes (system-wide or focused).
